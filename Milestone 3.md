# Natural Disaster AI Request For Quotation (RFQ)

## Introduction:

This application is a website AI that helps a user obtain resources and services during natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes. The user will ask questions to the AI about what steps are needed to combat this specific natural disaster. The AI will provide detailed information about what effects the disaster will cause in its path and what measures are needed to be taken to prevent any harm from befalling the user. The purpose of the RFQ will show the system interaction with users that lead them to interact with suppliers and service providers from the website AI.

## Scope of Work/ Requirements:

The website AI will need to have a certain computational algorithm to tell what need for the users need and to link them to the resource they need. The following requirements are:

### Platform:

* We need a secure website URL that allows users to access from any type of device.

### Data Compiler:

* They need to process data the administrator and user are submitting and use it for future use.
* Able to perform actions that allow people to access resources and services.

### Analytical Capabilities:

* The AI must analyze the information given to them by the user to know what they need according to the scenario.
* The AI must recognize patterns that users interacting on the website so that it allows the user to use it more efficiently the more they use the website.
* The computation to predict what the user needs to prevent according to the disaster.

### Performance:

* The website must synchronize the data with time so that it can become accurate in offering service to people before, during, after the disaster with no delay.

### Security:

* The website will ensure data encryption of user’s personal information.

### Payment:

* Through user “one-click purchases” we gain a small percentage of the total purchasings from our sponsors.

## Supplier Qualifications:

* The supplier and service must have authorization and proper government regulations to perform the service in question.
* The supplier and service must have at least 4 years of experience in supply to consumers.
* The supplier and service must show proof of effective management to deal with these scenarios.
