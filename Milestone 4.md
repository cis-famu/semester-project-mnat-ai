# Lesson Learned Report for MNat.ai

This report is to show what knowledge and skills we gathered through this process. We were able to help each other with many aspects of this project which led to the successful completion of it. Below is the Lessons Learned statement and also a reflection of our improvements over the duration of this project.

## Ronnie Burns

I learned a multitude of things during this project from skills to new ideas to new concepts I can now apply to my professional development. Transferring the project manager role between me and my group throughout each milestone gave me valuable experience from every level of a project.

Also learning about different planning techniques such as a style guide, and ways to formulate data like DFDs showed not only how much goes into a project, but also how important things like communication and delegation are when you have lots of moving parts in a project.

Designing the project was fun and it was satisfying bringing it to life. However, more importantly reflecting on the project, I realize that establishing dedicated work periods would have helped me better manage my time better with all my obligations.

I also recognized that strengthening our communication channels through regular check-ins could have enhanced team clarity and overall project flow.

Moving forward, I plan to integrate these strategies to create a more balanced and efficient approach to both my time management and collaborative efforts with any new projects.

## Calvin Mitchell

My takeaway so far from this project is how to delegate tasks to my fellow teammates and further improve upon my leadership skills.

The team has done a great job of completing the tasks I assigned them with little setback. They're very receptive to any kind of comment that is made by me or the professor, which I'm extremely grateful for especially due to the severity of this project.

This project has taught me the ins and outs of creating a start-up, along with other information pertaining to my major, to see out this vision of a future project. With each assignment we continue to hone our craft and better the quality of our work with each milestone.

## Jamal Person

This project helped me understand what creating a project for a professional business making a product is like. Everyone must fulfill their role when completing the project because it will not come together if one part is missing.

In the future, ensure that the people working together are coordinated well enough that there will be no setbacks when meeting each other.

The projects are being done according to the instructions and improved to meet the expectations.
