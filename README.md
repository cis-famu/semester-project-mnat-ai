# About the Project
The purpose of the application is to provide individuals in high-risk natural disaster areas with personalized emergency escape plans and real-time resources to enhance their safety and preparedness. The app will offer customized evacuation routes, supply checklists, and local shelter information, along with a chatbot that can answer disaster-related questions in real-time.  The app addresses a critical need for personalized emergency preparedness, as natural disasters are becoming more frequent and severe. The growing focus on disaster resilience creates market opportunities, with potential revenue streams from premium subscriptions, affiliate partnerships with retailers, and collaborations with emergency retailers. With the application integrating GIS mapping, real-time weather data, and supply recommendations, it offers unique, tech-driven solutions that enhance emergency readiness and response.


# Milestones
In this section we summarize each milestone and link to a more detail document of artifacts for each.

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, we are formalizing our project idea by creating our project charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. We also create out high-level budget and time estimates.
