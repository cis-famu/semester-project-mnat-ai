**The Natural Disasters Project Team Contract** 

Team Name: The Natural Disasters  			Date: 2/21/2025

| GOALS: What are our team goals for this project?  What do we want to accomplish? What skills do we want to develop or refine? |
| :---- |
|  The goal for this project is to provide a service for Floridans who are unaware of how to prepare for upcoming hurricanes or other natural disasters in Florida. The skills we want to develop are communication and delegation. Due to the fact that many of us have very different schedules we plan on working on this with constant communication. Further, we want to develop an environment that allows for more creativity to flow through the team.   |
| EXPECTATIONS: What do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.? |
|  Expectations are for everyone to turn in their part on time and if there’s any questions about the work to communicate as soon as they have that question. The team is expected to meet at least once a week, possibly on the weekends, but that will always be discussed with the team. Attendance must be a majority, meaning it must be ¾ members MUST be able to attend. Group participation is heavily encouraged, but it’s okay for a member to not have an idea at the moment.   |
| POLICIES & PROCEDURES: What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?  |
|  Message the group chat when there’s a question or issue pertaining to an assignment.  Message/email in a timely manner.  let the other members know if you’re not going to make it to a meeting to make future accommodations  If there are any issues with an assignment or team member, let me (CJ) know, then we try to work it out, if that fails we contact the professor.  Keep it respectful and do your due diligence.   |
| CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance in regard to these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?  |
|  First warning will be a conversation amongst the team, no names will be stated specifically just a general heads up.  Second warning will be a 1 on 1 conversation with me (CJ) on how to resolve this issue and what steps we will take to make sure this doesn’t happen anymore. Third warning will be an email/conversation with the professor.   |

We share these goals and expectations, and agree to these policies, procedures, and consequences.
